All the prevention\nmedicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health.\nYou can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough\nto have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a\nterminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing\nas "adequately covered" and there never will be. \n\nAnd for what it\'s worth, I\'ll be the first to admit that all my\npatients die.\n\n-km\n
